# RESUME MATCHER - Frontend

This project is the frontend for RESUME MATCHER, an NLP-powered system to match resumes with job descriptions. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn)
- Backend server running (see backend README for instructions)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the necessary dependencies for the frontend application.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
